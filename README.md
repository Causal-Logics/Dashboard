# This project is an interactive dashboard based on resesrch I conducted at the Army War College. It is intended to have the user enter an event, date range, and actors and then aggregate news stories on the event. The news stories are then assembled in sequential order and classified based on time and key words using natural language processing. Finally, using data I collected from the Battle of Sadr City in 2008, the user will then be able to observe the other actors behavior, determine their actions, and then observe the probabilities of civilian casualties based on those decisions. In summary, this is intended to be used as a decision support tool for leaders with the intent to deescalate and minimize civilian casualties in conflict areas.
